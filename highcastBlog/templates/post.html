    <p>The best place, according to insta bloggers, regulars at techno-raves, is considered to be the Stackenschneider club, in the party just "Staken". They hang out here from midnight until the morning under the underground sound worthy according to the youth. If you are in the topic, come listen to fierce European experimental DJs in electronic music. The wildest parties in the techno-rave culture take place in the "Staken", from recent shocks: PPF Pre Party, MixCult Night with Andrey Pushkarev, Sumeba Miyako.
An interesting and informative fact club is named after the Russian architect Andrey Shtakenshneider, and until 2014 was located on Millionnaya Street, in the house where the architect worked. After the "Shtaken" was moved to Konyushennaya Square, making the interior more brutal.</p>
    <h3>Kuznya House - endless stream of House music</h3>
    <img src="{% static '/img/Photo4.png' %}" align="left" hspace="40px">
    <p>Kuznya House in the building of the former forge on New Holland literally in a month became a place of power in club Petersburg. An atmospheric institution in a historical location with a pre—revolutionary interior and a touch of snobbery - this seems to be exactly what the St. Petersburg bohemian community wanted. Here you can dance from the heart, and talk about high things over a glass of wine, twitching your foot to the rhythm of the music.
Usually those who are involved in a fashionable party get here, who have been hanging out in the "Idlers" all summer and still miss the "House of Life". Face control is appropriate — they are more likely to be allowed in "newbalances" than in boots. With the expectation of dancing, it is definitely worth going to the "Kuznya" only in the middle of the night (1:00-2:00). The best electronic engineers of St. Petersburg and Moscow usually gather at the console, or someone brought. </p>
